# Electricity Consumption Surveys

Estimating the demand for electricity is a critical step in the design of a medium to long term energy plan. Frequently, estimates are based on time series with few observation points or on data from other countries or regions. Microsimulation models use household surveys to offer an alternative estimation route based on observed electricity demand by households with different incomes.

## Getting Started

This repository contains a python module : [IPCmicrosimTool](https://github.com/un-modelling/Electricity_Consumption_Surveys/blob/master/ipc_microsim_tool/ipc_microsim_tool.py) that can be used to run micro-simulation. It contains 2 basic component : 
* [Model](https://github.com/un-modelling/Electricity_Consumption_Surveys/blob/master/ipc_microsim_tool/ipc_microsim_tool.py) : IPCmicrosimTool module
* [Example code](https://github.com/un-modelling/Electricity_Consumption_Surveys/blob/master/ipc_microsim_tool/ipc_microsim_tool.ipynb) on how to run the model using iPython
* [Data input](https://github.com/un-modelling/Electricity_Consumption_Surveys/tree/master/ipc_microsim_tool/data)
* [Result](https://github.com/un-modelling/Electricity_Consumption_Surveys/tree/master/ipc_microsim_tool/result)
* [Paper](https://github.com/un-modelling/Electricity_Consumption_Surveys/blob/master/IPC.microsim.tool.pdf)
